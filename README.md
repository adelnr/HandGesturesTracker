# HandGesturesTracker

This project demonstrates hand gesture recognition using the Mediapipe library and PyAutoGUI. It allows you to control your computer's mouse cursor and perform actions by using hand gestures detected through your webcam.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Mediapipe (`pip install mediapipe`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pip install pyautogui`)

## Usage

1. Make sure your webcam is connected and functional.

2. Run the `main.py` script.

3. A window will open showing the live webcam feed with hand landmarks highlighted.

4. Raise your index finger to move the mouse cursor. The cursor position is mapped based on the movement of your hand.

5. Bring your thumb close to your index finger to perform a click action.

6. Press 'q' to quit the application.
